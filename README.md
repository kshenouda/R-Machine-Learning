# R-Data-Analysis

# This repository contains projects I've completed from a Udemy course. I'm currently taking a R course for machine learning, and I'm applying my knowledge in Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors, and other machine learning algorithms into several projects. The datasets come from the course itself and Kaggle.
